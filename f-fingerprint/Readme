1. cal_fingerprint 
   read a POSCAR file and calculate the F-fingerprint function (Eq. 3 in A. R. Oganov, M. Valle, J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 130, 104504.)
   The default values: 10.0 angstrom for cutoff R (i.e., maximum R), 100 for number of discretized R points, 0.05 angstrom for the sigma paramter in
   Gaussian smearing function. 

   Output files:  
   feature_ffpf.dat:   It contains one line for the discretized values of F-fingerprint function for all atom (species) pairs. 
   At most 30 atom (species) pairs.
   ffpf4plot.dat:  The pair of discretized values of R (1st column), F-fingerprint function (2nd, 3rd, ..., 31st columns) for different type of atom pair. 
   pcf4plot.dat: similar to ffpf4plot.dat, but the vlaues of atomic pair distribution function are written out.
   half_pcf4plot.dat: similar to pcf4plot.dat, but the R cutoff is taken as the half of the maximumal cell length.
   feature_geo.dat: the volume, metric tensor, and atomic pair distribution functions.  
2. CalFingerPrint.py
   A python script to call the binary executable file(cal_fingerprint).
